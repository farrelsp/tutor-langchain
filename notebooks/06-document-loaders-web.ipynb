The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 47 points, or 0.1%.The S&P 500 traded less than 1% below 6,147.43, the intraday record set on Feb. 19. It was also within reach of its closing all-time high of 6,144.15. On top of that, the Nasdaq traded less than 1% from its peak reached in December.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe S&P 500 in 2025.Wall Street's move toward record levels comes as trade tensions have eased and a ceasefire in the Middle East between Iran and Israel seems to be holding up. The truce went into effect on shaky footing on Tuesday, with both Israel and Iran accusing the other of violating the ceasefire just hours after it was announced.Week to date, the S&P 500 is up 2% after a tamer-than-expected Iranian response to U.S. attacks over the weekend. The following ceasefire — announced by President Donald Trump — also boosted equities, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the conflict wouldn't disrupt global crude supply.\"There is a battle in the markets between some of the secular tailwinds, which should positively impact asset prices long term (AI, robotics, crypto, and many other technological innovations), and the cyclical headwinds of possible policy missteps,\" said Leah Bennett, chief investment strategist at Concurrent Asset Management. \"The former seems to be winning today.\"At one point, the S&P 500 was nearly 20% below its record high — with investors fearing rising tariffs from the U.S. would tip the global economy into a recession. However, labor and inflation data has held up despite those concerns.Investors will watch Wednesday for data on new home sales due in the morning.

Jordan added that her price target increase includes an M&A valuation.Shares of Kraft Heinz have stumbled 15% this year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKHC YTD chartJordan wrote that she was upgraded the stock after the company's previously announced review of strategic alternatives could lead to a more balanced risk-reward ratio.\"On May 20th, KHC announced it has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value, along with the step down of two board members from its top shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway (owns 27.5%),\" she said. \"Should its largest shareholder be looking to sell-down its position after 10+ years of ownership (as suggested by media reports), monetizing assets could be utilized to enable buybacks.\"Jordan continued: \"Specifically, KHC has a portfolio of well-known brands, thus we acknowledge there are potential actions which could be accretive to shareholders.\"— Lisa Kailai Han3 Hours AgoWells Fargo cuts Sunrun price target citing Trump’s proposed budget billPresident Donald Trump's proposed budget bill has made Wells Fargo less uncertain when it comes to Sunrun.While analyst Michael Blum stood by his overweight rating on the solar stock, he cut his price target to $8 per share from $10.
