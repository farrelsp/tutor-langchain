      "\n",
      "1. **Size and Composition**: Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles). It's composed primarily of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and sulfur, which make up about 71% of its mass. The remaining 29% consists of hydrogen, helium, and other elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Climate and Weather**: Earth's climate is characterized by a diverse range of temperatures, from the freezing cold in polar regions to the scorching hot in desert areas. The atmosphere traps heat from the Sun, resulting in global temperature variations between day and night. This, combined with ocean currents and atmospheric circulation patterns, creates various weather phenomena such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Geological Features**: Earth's surface is shaped by geological processes that have been occurring for billions of years. The planet has three main types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks, which form through different mechanisms like volcanic activity, weathering, and tectonic movement. These processes have created iconic features such as mountains (like the Himalayas), canyons (like the Grand Canyon), and oceans (like the\n"

The amount of oxygen in the air is perfect for humans, but it's different for animals, plants, and even some microorganisms.\n",

From colorful fish to giant squid, these oceans support an estimated 75% of all marine species! And did you know that the ocean helps regulate our climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air?\n",
